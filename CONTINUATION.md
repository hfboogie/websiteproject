# Development Continuation Guide

This document provides information for continuing development on the MTG deck building website project. It outlines the current status, completed work, and next steps to ensure smooth continuation of development.

## Current Status (March 28, 2025)

We have successfully implemented the following features:

1. Basic Next.js application structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. Scryfall API integration for card data
3. Natural language search using OpenAI API
4. Deck building functionality with automatic categorization
5. User authentication system with email/password login
6. Deck evaluation statistics

## Recent Work Completed

### User Authentication
- Implemented email/password authentication using NextAuth.js
- Created user registration and login pages
- Added protected profile page
- Set up Prisma with SQLite database for user management
- Added placeholder for Google OAuth integration (to be completed later)

### Natural Language Search Fixes
- Fixed OpenAI API integration by adding the API key to environment variables
- Improved error handling in the translation API route
- Added parentheses balancing to prevent "unclosed parentheses" errors
- Enhanced the system prompt for better translation accuracy

### UX Design Planning
- Reviewed Moxfield and Archidekt interfaces for inspiration
- Created detailed color scheme options (see `/design/color_schemes.md`)
- Documented comprehensive UX improvements (see `/design/ux_improvements.md`)
- Prioritized implementation tasks based on user feedback

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Implement Color Scheme**: Choose and implement one of the proposed color schemes
2. **Enhance Card Search**: Improve the autocomplete dropdown with card images
3. **Add View Toggle**: Implement visual/text representation toggle
4. **Improve Category Management**: Enhance auto-categorization and custom category features
5. **Refine Natural Language Search**: Ensure perfect functionality for all query types

### Medium-Term Tasks
1. **Implement Drag-and-Drop**: Add drag-and-drop functionality for card organization
2. **Enhance Deck Statistics**: Add visual representations of deck statistics
3. **Improve Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize all components for mobile devices
4. **Add Google OAuth**: Complete the Google authentication integration
5. **Implement TCGPlayer Affiliate Links**: Add monetization through card purchase links

### Long-Term Tasks
1. **AI-Powered Deck Analysis**: Implement subjective deck analysis using OpenAI
2. **User Deck Sharing**: Add functionality to share decks publicly or privately
3. **Collection Management**: Add personal collection tracking features
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Implement advanced card filtering and sorting options
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for larger decks and collections

## Development Environment

To continue development:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/hfboogie/websiteproject.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables in `.env` file:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret-key-change-in-production"
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
   ```
4. Initialize the database: `npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push`
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Known Issues

1. ESLint warnings about TypeScript `any` types in several components
2. Image optimization warnings (using `<img>` instead of Next.js `<Image>`)
3. Some components need refactoring for better type safety
4. Natural language search occasionally returns incomplete results for complex queries

## Implementation Notes

### Color Scheme Implementation
The color scheme should be implemented using CSS variables in `globals.css` and Tailwind configuration. This will allow for easy theme switching in the future.

### Card Search Enhancements
The `AutocompleteInput` component needs to be extended to include card images in the dropdown. This will require modifying the Scryfall API calls to include image data.

### Category Management
The drag-and-drop functionality should be implemented using react-dnd, which is already included in the project. The `DeckBuilder` component will need to be updated to handle the new organization features.
