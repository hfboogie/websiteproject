# Project Continuation Instructions

## Current Progress
We've successfully implemented:
1. Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. Scryfall API integration
3. Natural language search interface using OpenAI
4. Card display and filtering components
5. Deck building functionality with drag-and-drop
6. Moxfield-style autocomplete for card search
7. Improved search accuracy with parentheses balancing

## To Continue This Project
When starting a new session, provide this message:

"Let's continue working on the MTG website project. We left off after implementing the Moxfield-style autocomplete and improving search accuracy. The next steps are to implement deck evaluation features (similar to deckcheck.co) and monetization features (affiliate links to TCGPlayer, Card Kingdom, etc.)."

## Next Steps
1. **Deck Evaluation Features** (Step 8)
   - Analyze mana curve
   - Evaluate land count based on mana value
   - Suggest card improvements
   - Compare with similar successful decks

2. **Monetization Features** (Step 9)
   - TCGPlayer affiliate integration
   - Card Kingdom/Card Trader links
   - Ad placement spaces
   - Premium feature placeholders

## Project Structure
- `/app`: Next.js app router pages and API routes
- `/components`: React components (SearchBar, CardGrid, DeckBuilder)
- `/lib/api`: API clients for Scryfall and OpenAI
